A C++ source file!

As a senior C++ developer, I'll review the code and provide some feedback.

**Overall structure**
The code appears to be a C++ class `PersonInfo` that represents a person's information. The class has several member variables to store various attributes (e.g., ID, job title, department name) and a few methods to manipulate these attributes.

**Code organization**
The code is well-organized into separate sections: constructor, getter/setter methods, and the `toJson()` method. This makes it easy to follow the flow of the program.

**Constructors and getters/setters**
The constructor takes no arguments, which might be acceptable if this class is not intended to be used with polymorphism (e.g., inheritance). The getters and setters are straightforward and consistent in their naming convention (`getValueOfXYZ()` and `getXYZ()`).

**ToJson() method**
This method creates a JSON value object using the `Json::Value` class. It iterates through the member variables, setting the corresponding JSON values if the attribute is not null or empty.

**Suggestions**

1. **Consider const correctness**: Some of the getter methods could be marked as `const`, since they do not modify the object's state.
2. **Use a more descriptive name for the constructor**: Instead of having a default constructor, you might consider naming it something like `PersonInfo()` to indicate its purpose.
3. **Handle null values in getters/setters**: Some getter methods (e.g., `getValueOfJobTitle()`) return a default value (`std::string` in this case) if the attribute is null or empty. You could also provide an overload that takes an optional argument, like `getValueOfJobTitle(const std::optional<std::string>& optJobTitle = std::nullopt)` to handle cases where the attribute might be null.
4. **Consider adding a `toString()` method**: A method that returns a string representation of the object could be useful for debugging or logging purposes.

Overall, the code looks clean and easy to follow. With some minor adjustments, it should be even more robust and maintainable.
