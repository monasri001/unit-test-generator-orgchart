A C++ source file!

As a senior C++ developer, I'll help you understand the code. This is a `Person` class, which appears to be part of a larger system for managing an organization's chart. The class has several member variables and functions that seem to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Here are some key observations:

1. **Member variables**: The class has six member variables: `id_`, `jobId_`, `departmentId_`, `managerId_`, `firstName_`, and `lastName_`. These appear to represent attributes of a person.
2. **Functions**:
	* `get` functions (e.g., `getId`, `getJobId`) that return the values of the member variables.
	* `set` functions (e.g., `setId`, `setJobId`) that set the values of the member variables.
	* `outputArgs` and `updateArgs` functions that seem to handle SQL queries.
	* `sqlForInserting` function that generates a SQL INSERT statement based on which attributes are dirty (i.e., changed).
3. **Static members**:
	* `metaData_`: an array of `MetaData` structures, which likely contain metadata about each attribute (e.g., column name, type, length).
	* `dirtyFlag_[7]`: an array of boolean values indicating whether each attribute is dirty.
4. **Friend classes**: The class has friend relationships with `drogon::orm::Mapper<Person>` and (conditionally) `drogon::orm::CoroMapper<Person>`, which suggests that this class is part of a larger OR-Mapper system.

Some things to note:

* The code uses C++11 features, such as `std::shared_ptr` and `const std::string`.
* The use of `static` members suggests that the class may be intended for singleton-like behavior or thread-safety.
* The presence of `LOG_TRACE` logging statements implies that the system uses some form of logging mechanism.

Overall, this code appears to be part of a larger system for managing an organization's chart, and it seems to provide CRUD operations and metadata management for persons.
